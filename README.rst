This is originally based on the `quickspec <https://github.com/dhanson/quickspec>`_ package from Duncan Hanson. Our goal is to extend the legacy value of this package by adding tests, continuous integration, wide-ranging compatibility, and documentation.

`quickspec` is still in the early-development stage. While much of the
functionality is already working as intended, the API is not yet stable.
Nevertheless, we kindly invite you to use and test the library and we are
grateful for feedback. Note, that work on the documentation is still ongoing.
